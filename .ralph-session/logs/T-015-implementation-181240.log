You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-015 - Add comprehensive testing and documentation

Write backend tests (service layer unit tests, API integration tests, WebSocket tests). Write frontend tests (component unit tests, E2E tests with Playwright). Update documentation (README with ralph serve usage, architecture docs, API reference). Perform manual testing checklist. Ensure zero regression in existing CLI functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- tests/services/ directory with unit tests for all services (orchestration, project, session, config, git)
- tests/integration/test_api.py with tests for all REST endpoints
- tests/integration/test_websocket.py with WebSocket lifecycle and broadcasting tests
- frontend/src/__tests__/ with component unit tests (Jest/React Testing Library)
- frontend/e2e/ with Playwright tests covering: start task, monitor progress, create branch/PR, edit config
- README.md updated with ralph serve documentation and examples
- docs/architecture.md created documenting service layer, event system, API design
- docs/api.md with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- All existing CLI integration tests pass (no regressions)
- Manual testing checklist completed and documented
- Test coverage >80% for new code
