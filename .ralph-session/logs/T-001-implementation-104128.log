# Command: claude --print --model claude-opus-4-5-20251101 --allowedTools Read,Write,Glob,LS,Grep,Shell,Edit -p '# Implementation Task

You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-001 - Audit existing architecture and identify refactoring boundaries

Analyze current codebase structure (cli.py, run.py, session.py, gates.py, agents/) to identify which logic must be extracted into services layer. Document current dependencies, coupling points, and event emission points needed for real-time updates. Map out how to preserve CLI functionality while making core logic reusable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete dependency map created showing all modules and their interactions
- List of logic to extract from cli.py, run.py into services layer documented
- Event emission points identified for WebSocket broadcasting (task start/stop, agent transitions, gate execution, signal detection)
- CLI preservation strategy documented (keep commands as thin wrappers)
- No breaking changes identified for existing CLI commands

## Report Output

Write a brief summary of your work to: /Users/edouardgouilliard/Documents/Leyton/CAES/ralph-orchestrator/.ralph-session/reports/T-001/implementation.md
This is an append-only file. Add a timestamped section for each iteration.
Format:
```
## Implementation - [timestamp]
- What was done
- Files modified
- Notes for next iteration (if any)
```

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260127-104128-99f4a819a1228cee">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260127-104128-99f4a819a1228cee

# STDOUT:
I have completed the architecture audit for T-001. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

I analyzed the Ralph Orchestrator codebase and found that a comprehensive architecture audit document already exists at `docs/architecture-audit-T001.md`. I verified that it satisfies all acceptance criteria:

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

1. **Complete dependency map created** ✅
   - 17 modules mapped with import relationships
   - Coupling scores assigned (session.py: LOW, run.py: VERY HIGH)
   - Visual architecture diagram included

2. **Logic extraction list documented** ✅
   - From `cli.py`: 6 functions (generate_tasks_from_markdown, analyze_complexity_for_task_count, etc.)
   - From `run.py`: 8 components (RunEngine class, _run_implementation, _run_test_writing, etc.)
   - Proposed services: ExecutionService, TaskGenerationService, GateService, etc.

3. **Event emission points identified** ✅
   - 22 existing timeline events (SESSION_START, TASK_START, AGENT_START, GATE_PASS, etc.)
   - 5 new events proposed (ITERATION_START, OUTPUT_CHUNK, PROGRESS_UPDATE, etc.)
   - EventBus integration strategy documented

4. **CLI preservation strategy documented** ✅
   - "Thin wrapper" pattern with OutputHandler protocol
   - All 10 CLI commands verified for backward compatibility

5. **No breaking changes identified** ✅
   - All arguments, exit codes, and file formats preserved
   - Environment variables maintained
   - Signal formats unchanged

The implementation report has been written to `.ralph-session/reports/T-001/implementation.md`.

<task-done session="ralph-20260127-104128-99f4a819a1228cee">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- Reviewed and verified existing architecture audit document at docs/architecture-audit-T001.md
- Created implementation report at .ralph-session/reports/T-001/implementation.md
- All 5 acceptance criteria verified as satisfied:
  - Dependency map with 17 modules and coupling analysis
  - Logic extraction list from cli.py (6 functions) and run.py (8 components)
  - 22 existing + 5 proposed event emission points for WebSocket
  - CLI preservation strategy with thin wrapper pattern
  - No breaking changes confirmed for all commands, args, and formats
