You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-001 - Audit existing architecture and identify refactoring boundaries

Analyze current codebase structure (cli.py, run.py, session.py, gates.py, agents/) to identify which logic must be extracted into services layer. Document current dependencies, coupling points, and event emission points needed for real-time updates. Map out how to preserve CLI functionality while making core logic reusable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete dependency map created showing all modules and their interactions
- List of logic to extract from cli.py, run.py into services layer documented
- Event emission points identified for WebSocket broadcasting (task start/stop, agent transitions, gate execution, signal detection)
- CLI preservation strategy documented (keep commands as thin wrappers)
- No breaking changes identified for existing CLI commands

Please address these issues in this iteration.

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260127-090628-18a37c3dd4b3ba7a">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260127-090628-18a37c3dd4b3ba7a

# STDOUT:
<task-done session="ralph-20260127-090628-18a37c3dd4b3ba7a">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- Fixed test_cli_to_run_engine_flow in tests/integration/test_t001_architecture_integration_complete.py by adding required config fields `version: "1"` and `git: { base_branch: "main" }` to the test YAML configuration
- Fixed test_config_can_be_loaded_independently in the same file by adding the same required config fields
- Both tests were failing because the ralph config schema requires `version`, `task_source`, and `git` fields, but the tests were only providing `task_source` and `gates`
