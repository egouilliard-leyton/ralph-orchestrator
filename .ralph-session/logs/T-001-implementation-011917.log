# Command: claude --print --model claude-opus-4-5-20251101 --allowedTools Read,Write,Glob,LS,Grep,Shell,Edit -p '# Implementation Task

You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-001 - Audit existing architecture and identify refactoring boundaries

Analyze current codebase structure (cli.py, run.py, session.py, gates.py, agents/) to identify which logic must be extracted into services layer. Document current dependencies, coupling points, and event emission points needed for real-time updates. Map out how to preserve CLI functionality while making core logic reusable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete dependency map created showing all modules and their interactions
- List of logic to extract from cli.py, run.py into services layer documented
- Event emission points identified for WebSocket broadcasting (task start/stop, agent transitions, gate execution, signal detection)
- CLI preservation strategy documented (keep commands as thin wrappers)
- No breaking changes identified for existing CLI commands

## Previous Feedback

The previous attempt had issues that need to be addressed:

Claude CLI error: Command timed out after 1800s

Please address these issues in this iteration.

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260126-180523-9f7d0b0a0be6442e">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260126-180523-9f7d0b0a0be6442e

# STDOUT:
The architecture audit document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me verify it meets all acceptance criteria:

**Acceptance Criteria Verification:**

1. ✅ **Complete dependency map created showing all modules and their interactions**
   - Section 1: Module Dependency Map (lines 9-91)
   - Includes hierarchy, import matrix, visual diagram, and coupling analysis

2. ✅ **List of logic to extract from cli.py, run.py into services layer documented**
   - Section 2: Logic Extraction (lines 94-147)
   - Section 8.1: cli.py Analysis with line numbers (lines 412-437)
   - Section 8.2: run.py Analysis with line numbers (lines 439-457)

3. ✅ **Event emission points identified for WebSocket broadcasting**
   - Section 3.1: Required Events table (lines 155-172)
   - Section 3.2: New Events Needed (lines 174-182)
   - Section 3.3: EventBus Implementation (lines 184-212)
   - Section 3.4: Integration Points with line numbers (lines 214-228)

4. ✅ **CLI preservation strategy documented (keep commands as thin wrappers)**
   - Section 4: CLI Preservation Strategy (lines 231-324)
   - Before/After refactoring patterns
   - OutputHandler protocol
   - Backward compatibility checklist

5. ✅ **No breaking changes identified for existing CLI commands**
   - Section 5: Breaking Change Analysis (lines 327-355)
   - Section 9: Full verification of commands, env vars, file formats, signals (lines 512-557)
   - Section 11: Acceptance Criteria Verification table (lines 591-599)

The existing document is thorough and addresses all acceptance criteria. The task has been completed successfully.
