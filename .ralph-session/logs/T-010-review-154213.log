You are reviewing code changes against acceptance criteria.

## IMPORTANT: READ-ONLY MODE

You may NOT modify any files. You can only:
- Read files to review the implementation
- Approve or reject based on criteria

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-010 - Build multi-project dashboard UI

Create ProjectList component showing all discovered projects in grid/list view. Each project card shows name, branch, task count, status, last activity. Implement quick actions (open project, start autopilot). Add global search and filters. Connect to GET /api/projects endpoint and WebSocket for real-time updates.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] src/pages/index.tsx created as dashboard landing page
- [ ] src/components/ProjectList.tsx component displays grid of project cards
- [ ] ProjectCard component shows: project name, current branch, task counts (pending/in-progress/completed), status badge, last activity timestamp
- [ ] Quick actions on each card: Open (navigate to detail), Start Autopilot
- [ ] Global search filters projects by name
- [ ] Status filter (active, idle, errors)
- [ ] Toggle between grid and list view
- [ ] WebSocket connection updates project status in real-time without refresh
- [ ] Loading states and empty state handled
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile/tablet
