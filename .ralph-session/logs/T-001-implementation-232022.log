# Command: claude --print --model claude-opus-4-5-20251101 --allowedTools Read,Write,Glob,LS,Grep,Shell,Edit -p '# Implementation Task

You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-001 - Audit existing architecture and identify refactoring boundaries

Analyze current codebase structure (cli.py, run.py, session.py, gates.py, agents/) to identify which logic must be extracted into services layer. Document current dependencies, coupling points, and event emission points needed for real-time updates. Map out how to preserve CLI functionality while making core logic reusable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete dependency map created showing all modules and their interactions
- List of logic to extract from cli.py, run.py into services layer documented
- Event emission points identified for WebSocket broadcasting (task start/stop, agent transitions, gate execution, signal detection)
- CLI preservation strategy documented (keep commands as thin wrappers)
- No breaking changes identified for existing CLI commands

## Previous Feedback

The previous attempt had issues that need to be addressed:

Claude CLI error: Command timed out after 1800s

Please address these issues in this iteration.

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260126-180523-9f7d0b0a0be6442e">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260126-180523-9f7d0b0a0be6442e

# STDOUT:
The architecture audit document at `docs/architecture-audit-T001.md` is complete and comprehensive. It covers all the acceptance criteria:

1. **Complete dependency map** - Section 1 provides detailed module dependencies with visual diagrams
2. **Logic extraction list** - Sections 2 and 8 document specific functions/lines to extract from cli.py and run.py
3. **Event emission points** - Section 3 identifies 23+ event types for WebSocket broadcasting with source locations
4. **CLI preservation strategy** - Section 4 documents the thin wrapper pattern with code examples
5. **No breaking changes** - Section 9 verifies all CLI commands, environment variables, and file formats remain unchanged

<task-done session="ralph-20260126-180523-9f7d0b0a0be6442e">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- Verified existing comprehensive architecture audit document at docs/architecture-audit-T001.md
- Document covers complete dependency map (Section 1) with visual diagrams showing all module interactions
- Logic extraction documented (Sections 2, 8) with specific line numbers for cli.py (979 lines) and run.py (705 lines)
- 23 event emission points identified (Section 3) for WebSocket broadcasting including task start/stop, agent transitions, gate execution, and signal detection
- CLI preservation strategy documented (Section 4) with thin wrapper pattern and backward compatibility checklist
- No breaking changes verified (Section 9) - all CLI commands, environment variables, file formats, and signal formats preserved
