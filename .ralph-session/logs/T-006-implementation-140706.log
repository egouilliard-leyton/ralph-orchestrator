You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-006 - Create FastAPI application with REST endpoints

Create server/api.py with FastAPI application. Implement all REST endpoints for project management, task operations, config management, git operations, logs, and timeline. Endpoints should call services layer and return JSON responses. Add CORS, error handling, and input validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- server/api.py created with FastAPI app instance
- GET /api/projects endpoint returns all discovered projects
- GET /api/projects/{project_id} returns project details
- GET /api/projects/{project_id}/tasks returns tasks from prd.json
- POST /api/projects/{project_id}/run starts task execution
- POST /api/projects/{project_id}/stop cancels execution
- GET /api/projects/{project_id}/config returns ralph.yml contents
- PUT /api/projects/{project_id}/config updates and validates ralph.yml
- GET /api/projects/{project_id}/branches lists git branches with status
- POST /api/projects/{project_id}/branches creates new branch
- POST /api/projects/{project_id}/pr creates pull request
- GET /api/projects/{project_id}/logs returns log files
- GET /api/projects/{project_id}/timeline returns timeline.jsonl events
- CORS configured for localhost development
- All endpoints have proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Request validation using Pydantic models

```

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5
