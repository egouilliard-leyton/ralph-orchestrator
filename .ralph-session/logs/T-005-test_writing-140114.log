You are writing tests for implemented features.

## CRITICAL FILE RESTRICTIONS

You may ONLY create/modify files matching these patterns:
- tests/**
- test_scripts/**
- **/test_*.py
- **/*_test.py

**ALLOWED:**
- Python test files (e.g., `tests/**/test_*.py`, `tests/**/*_test.py`)
- Test fixture files, conftest.py

**FORBIDDEN (will be reverted):**
- ANY markdown files (*.md) in tests/ - DO NOT create documentation in tests/
- ANY source files outside test directories
- Test result documents or reports in tests/

Any modifications to forbidden paths will be **automatically reverted**.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-005 - Implement event system for real-time broadcasting

Create server/events.py with event type definitions and event emitter/subscriber pattern. Design event schema for all UI updates (task started/completed, agent output, gate execution, signal detection). Implement event queue and broadcasting mechanism that will integrate with WebSocket layer.

## Acceptance Criteria

- server/events.py created with Event base class
- Event types defined: TaskStarted, TaskCompleted, AgentOutput, AgentPhaseChanged, GateRunning, GateCompleted, SignalDetected, SessionChanged, ConfigChanged
- Each event includes: type, project_id, timestamp, and type-specific data
- EventEmitter class implemented with subscribe/emit methods
- EventQueue class for buffering events before WebSocket broadcast
- All services (orchestration, session, config, git) integrated with event emitter
- Unit tests verify events emitted at correct times with correct data

## TEST QUALITY RULES

You MUST follow these rules to avoid writing broken tests:

1. **Only assert on REAL public APIs**: Do not invent or assume attributes, methods, or behaviors that don'"'"'t exist. Read the actual source code to verify what the API provides before writing assertions.

2. **Prefer black-box assertions**: Test observable behavior rather than internal implementation:
   - CLI output and exit codes
   - File existence and content
   - Schema/structure validity
   - HTTP responses
   - Log output
   Avoid testing private attributes or internal state unless explicitly required.

3. **Keep scope tight**: Only write tests that verify the task'"'"'s acceptance criteria. Do not add speculative tests for features not mentioned in the criteria.

4. **Verify imports work**: Before using any import in a test, confirm the module and symbol exist in the codebase.

5. **No documentation in tests/**: Do not create `.md` files, test reports, or narrative documents in `tests/`. Write only executable test code.

## Report Output

Write a brief summary of your work to: /Users/edouardgouilliard/Documents/Leyton/CAES/ralph-orchestrator/.ralph-session/reports/T-005/test-writing.md
This is an append-only file. Add a timestamped section for each iteration.
Format:
```
## Test Writing - [timestamp]
- Tests created/modified
- Coverage notes
- Issues encountered (if any)
```

## Instructions

1. Read the implementation to understand what APIs and behaviors actually exist
2. Write focused tests that validate each acceptance criterion
3. Cover happy path and realistic edge cases
4. Only create/modify files in test directories (no .md files!)
5. Follow project testing conventions

Tests written and verified for T-005 event system:

**Test File:** tests/unit/test_events.py (1023 lines)

**Test Coverage:**
- Event base class: type, project_id, timestamp, event_id fields verified
- All 9 event types tested: TaskStarted, TaskCompleted, AgentOutput, AgentPhaseChanged, GateRunning, GateCompleted, SignalDetected, SessionChanged, ConfigChanged
- EventEmitter: subscribe/emit pattern with type-specific, global, and project-specific handlers
- EventQueue: buffering, FIFO ordering, filtering by type/project, max size eviction
- Service bridge: integration with orchestration, session, config, and git services
- Async operations: emit_async and dequeue_async
- Error handling: handler exceptions don't break emission
- Integration tests: complete event flow and multi-project isolation

**Test Results:** 59 tests passed in 0.15s

All acceptance criteria validated with comprehensive unit tests covering happy paths, edge cases, and integration scenarios.
