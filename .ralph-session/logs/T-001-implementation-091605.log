You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-001 - Audit existing architecture and identify refactoring boundaries

Analyze current codebase structure (cli.py, run.py, session.py, gates.py, agents/) to identify which logic must be extracted into services layer. Document current dependencies, coupling points, and event emission points needed for real-time updates. Map out how to preserve CLI functionality while making core logic reusable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete dependency map created showing all modules and their interactions
- List of logic to extract from cli.py, run.py into services layer documented
- Event emission points identified for WebSocket broadcasting (task start/stop, agent transitions, gate execution, signal detection)
- CLI preservation strategy documented (keep commands as thin wrappers)
- No breaking changes identified for existing CLI commands

Please address these issues in this iteration.

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260127-090628-18a37c3dd4b3ba7a">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260127-090628-18a37c3dd4b3ba7a

# STDOUT:
I've fixed the failing test. The issue was in the test logic at `tests/integration/test_t001_architecture_integration.py:311-328`. The original test was checking for `node.module.startswith(".")` to detect relative imports, but Python's AST module doesn't include the leading dot in the `module` attribute. Instead:

- For `from .run import X`, the AST has `module="run"` and `level=1`
- For `from . import __version__`, the AST has `module=None` and `level=1`

The correct way to detect relative imports is to check `node.level > 0`.

The fix changes the test to:
1. Check `node.level > 0` to identify relative imports
2. Extract the module name if present (e.g., `run` from `from .run import ...`)
3. For `from . import X` cases where module is None, extract the imported names directly

<task-done session="ralph-20260127-090628-18a37c3dd4b3ba7a">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- Fixed test_dependency_graph_extractable in tests/integration/test_t001_architecture_integration.py
- Changed detection logic from `node.module.startswith(".")` to `node.level > 0`
- Added handling for both `from .module import X` and `from . import X` cases
- The test now correctly extracts relative imports using Python's AST level attribute
