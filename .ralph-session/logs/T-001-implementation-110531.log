You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-001 - Audit existing architecture and identify refactoring boundaries

Analyze current codebase structure (cli.py, run.py, session.py, gates.py, agents/) to identify which logic must be extracted into services layer. Document current dependencies, coupling points, and event emission points needed for real-time updates. Map out how to preserve CLI functionality while making core logic reusable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete dependency map created showing all modules and their interactions
- List of logic to extract from cli.py, run.py into services layer documented
- Event emission points identified for WebSocket broadcasting (task start/stop, agent transitions, gate execution, signal detection)
- CLI preservation strategy documented (keep commands as thin wrappers)
- No breaking changes identified for existing CLI commands

## Report Output

Write a brief summary of your work to: /Users/edouardgouilliard/Documents/Leyton/CAES/ralph-orchestrator/.ralph-session/reports/T-001/implementation.md
This is an append-only file. Add a timestamped section for each iteration.
Format:
```
## Implementation - [timestamp]
- What was done
- Files modified
- Notes for next iteration (if any)
```

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260127-110531-f8f1b6dba4f4280d">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260127-110531-f8f1b6dba4f4280d

# STDOUT:
All acceptance criteria have been verified and met. The existing architecture audit document at `docs/architecture-audit-T001.md` is comprehensive and covers all requirements:

1. **Complete dependency map** - Section 1 with visual diagram and detailed module table
2. **Logic extraction list** - Sections 2.1, 2.2, 8.1-8.6 with line numbers for cli.py and run.py
3. **Event emission points** - Section 3 with 22 existing timeline events + 5 proposed new events
4. **CLI preservation strategy** - Section 4 with OutputHandler protocol and thin wrapper pattern
5. **No breaking changes** - Section 5 and 9 verifying all CLI commands, environment variables, file formats, and signal formats are preserved

<task-done session="ralph-20260127-110531-f8f1b6dba4f4280d">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- Verified existing comprehensive architecture audit document (docs/architecture-audit-T001.md)
- Reviewed all 13 core modules for coupling analysis and extraction boundaries
- Confirmed 22 existing event emission points in timeline.py ready for WebSocket broadcast
- Validated CLI commands as thin wrappers pattern (lazy imports → options → delegate → exit code)
- Updated implementation report with detailed verification notes at .ralph-session/reports/T-001/implementation.md
- All 5 acceptance criteria verified and documented with evidence
