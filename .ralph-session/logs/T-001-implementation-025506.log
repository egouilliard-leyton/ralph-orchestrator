You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-001 - Audit existing architecture and identify refactoring boundaries

Analyze current codebase structure (cli.py, run.py, session.py, gates.py, agents/) to identify which logic must be extracted into services layer. Document current dependencies, coupling points, and event emission points needed for real-time updates. Map out how to preserve CLI functionality while making core logic reusable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete dependency map created showing all modules and their interactions
- List of logic to extract from cli.py, run.py into services layer documented
- Event emission points identified for WebSocket broadcasting (task start/stop, agent transitions, gate execution, signal detection)
- CLI preservation strategy documented (keep commands as thin wrappers)
- No breaking changes identified for existing CLI commands

Please address these issues in this iteration.

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260126-180523-9f7d0b0a0be6442e">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260126-180523-9f7d0b0a0be6442e

# STDOUT:
The architecture audit task has been completed. Let me summarize what was done:

1. **Fixed the failing test** - The test `tests/integration/test_t001_architecture_integration.py::TestModuleDependencyIntegration::test_cli_to_run_integration` was failing because it used relative paths like `Path("ralph_orchestrator/cli.py")` which don't resolve correctly when pytest runs from different working directories. Fixed by:
   - Adding `PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent` to resolve the project root
   - Replacing all relative path references with `PROJECT_ROOT / "ralph_orchestrator/..."` 

2. **Fixed all other affected test files** using the same pattern:
   - `tests/unit/test_t001_services_layer_extraction.py`
   - `tests/unit/test_t001_refactoring_boundaries.py`
   - `tests/unit/test_t001_comprehensive_architecture_validation.py`
   - `tests/integration/test_t001_complete_architecture_validation.py`
   - `tests/unit/test_t001_codebase_refactoring_readiness.py`
   - `tests/unit/test_t001_refactoring_safety.py`
   - `tests/unit/test_t001_dependency_validation.py`
   - `tests/unit/test_t001_architecture_audit.py`

3. **Architecture audit documentation already exists** at `docs/architecture-audit-T001.md` and is comprehensive, covering:
   - Complete dependency map (Section 1)
   - Logic to extract from cli.py/run.py (Section 2)
   - Event emission points for WebSocket (Section 3)
   - CLI preservation strategy (Section 4)
   - No breaking changes analysis (Section 5)
   - Detailed file analysis with line numbers (Section 8)
   - CLI commands verification (Section 9)

<task-done session="ralph-20260126-180523-9f7d0b0a0be6442e">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- Fixed failing test by adding PROJECT_ROOT path resolution to test_t001_architecture_integration.py
- Fixed 8 additional test files that used relative paths for reading module source code
- All Path("ralph_orchestrator/...") references now use PROJECT_ROOT / "ralph_orchestrator/..." pattern
- Architecture audit documentation at docs/architecture-audit-T001.md verified complete per acceptance criteria
</task-done>
