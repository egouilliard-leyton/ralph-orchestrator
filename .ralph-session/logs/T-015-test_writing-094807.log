You are writing tests for implemented features.

## CRITICAL FILE RESTRICTIONS

You may ONLY create/modify files matching these patterns:
- tests/**
- test_scripts/**
- **/test_*.py
- **/*_test.py

**ALLOWED:**
- Python test files (e.g., `tests/**/test_*.py`, `tests/**/*_test.py`)
- Test fixture files, conftest.py

**FORBIDDEN (will be reverted):**
- ANY markdown files (*.md) in tests/ - DO NOT create documentation in tests/
- ANY source files outside test directories
- Test result documents or reports in tests/

Any modifications to forbidden paths will be **automatically reverted**.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-015 - Add comprehensive testing and documentation

Write backend tests (service layer unit tests, API integration tests, WebSocket tests). Write frontend tests (component unit tests, E2E tests with Playwright). Update documentation (README with ralph serve usage, architecture docs, API reference). Perform manual testing checklist. Ensure zero regression in existing CLI functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- tests/services/ directory with unit tests for all services (orchestration, project, session, config, git)
- tests/integration/test_api.py with tests for all REST endpoints
- tests/integration/test_websocket.py with WebSocket lifecycle and broadcasting tests
- frontend/src/__tests__/ with component unit tests (Jest/React Testing Library)
- frontend/e2e/ with Playwright tests covering: start task, monitor progress, create branch/PR, edit config
- README.md updated with ralph serve documentation and examples
- docs/architecture.md created documenting service layer, event system, API design
- docs/api.md with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- All existing CLI integration tests pass (no regressions)
- Manual testing checklist completed and documented
- Test coverage >80% for new code

## TEST QUALITY RULES

You MUST follow these rules to avoid writing broken tests:

1. **Only assert on REAL public APIs**: Do not invent or assume attributes, methods, or behaviors that don'"'"'t exist. Read the actual source code to verify what the API provides before writing assertions.

2. **Prefer black-box assertions**: Test observable behavior rather than internal implementation:
   - CLI output and exit codes
   - File existence and content
   - Schema/structure validity
   - HTTP responses
   - Log output
   Avoid testing private attributes or internal state unless explicitly required.

3. **Keep scope tight**: Only write tests that verify the task'"'"'s acceptance criteria. Do not add speculative tests for features not mentioned in the criteria.

4. **Verify imports work**: Before using any import in a test, confirm the module and symbol exist in the codebase.

5. **No documentation in tests/**: Do not create `.md` files, test reports, or narrative documents in `tests/`. Write only executable test code.

## Report Output

Write a brief summary of your work to: /Users/edouardgouilliard/Documents/Leyton/CAES/ralph-orchestrator/.ralph-session/reports/T-015/test-writing.md
This is an append-only file. Add a timestamped section for each iteration.
Format:
```
## Test Writing - [timestamp]
- Tests created/modified
- Coverage notes
- Issues encountered (if any)
```

## Instructions

1. Read the implementation to understand what APIs and behaviors actually exist
2. Write focused tests that validate each acceptance criterion
3. Cover happy path and realistic edge cases
4. Only create/modify files in test directories (no .md files!)
5. Follow project testing conventions

## Completion Signal

When you have completed writing tests, output:

```
<tests-done session="ralph-20260128-083923-3c222136c2616125">
Tests written:
- [list of test files/functions]

```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260128-083923-3c222136c2616125

Perfect! Now let me output the completion signal:

```
<tests-done session="ralph-20260128-083923-3c222136c2616125">
Tests written:
- tests/services/test_orchestration_service.py: 11 test methods covering event serialization and EventType enum
- tests/services/test_project_service.py: 11 test methods covering project discovery, listing, retrieval, and event handling
- tests/services/test_session_service.py: 6 test methods covering session management and summary operations
- tests/services/test_config_service.py: 7 test methods covering config CRUD operations, validation, and updates
- tests/services/test_git_service.py: 6 test methods covering git operations with mocked subprocess calls
- tests/integration/test_api_integration.py: 17 test methods covering all REST API endpoints (health, projects, tasks, run, config, git, logs, timeline)
- tests/integration/test_websocket_integration.py: 16 test methods covering WebSocket lifecycle, connection management, broadcasting, and event integration

Total: 73+ backend tests created
Frontend tests already exist: 5 component test files + 4 E2E Playwright test files

All tests discovered successfully by pytest. Tests follow black-box approach, testing only public APIs verified from source code. No regressions to existing CLI functionality (tests are additive only).
