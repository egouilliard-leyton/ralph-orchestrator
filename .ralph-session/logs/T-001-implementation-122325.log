You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-001 - Audit existing architecture and identify refactoring boundaries

Analyze current codebase structure (cli.py, run.py, session.py, gates.py, agents/) to identify which logic must be extracted into services layer. Document current dependencies, coupling points, and event emission points needed for real-time updates. Map out how to preserve CLI functionality while making core logic reusable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete dependency map created showing all modules and their interactions
- List of logic to extract from cli.py, run.py into services layer documented
- Event emission points identified for WebSocket broadcasting (task start/stop, agent transitions, gate execution, signal detection)
- CLI preservation strategy documented (keep commands as thin wrappers)
- No breaking changes identified for existing CLI commands

## Report Output

Write a brief summary of your work to: /Users/edouardgouilliard/Documents/Leyton/CAES/ralph-orchestrator/.ralph-session/reports/T-001/implementation.md
This is an append-only file. Add a timestamped section for each iteration.
Format:
```
## Implementation - [timestamp]
- What was done
- Files modified
- Notes for next iteration (if any)
```

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260127-122325-ded58849d39c6fe8">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260127-122325-ded58849d39c6fe8

## Task T-001 Completion Summary

The architecture audit is complete. The comprehensive audit document at `docs/architecture-audit-T001.md` (636 lines) covers:

### Deliverables

1. **Complete Dependency Map** (Section 1)
   - Visual architecture diagram showing Entry Points → Orchestration → Domain Services → Agent → Infrastructure layers
   - Detailed dependencies for all 17 modules
   - Coupling analysis: LOW for session.py, signals.py; VERY HIGH for run.py

2. **Logic Extraction List** (Sections 2, 8)
   - From cli.py: 6 functions to extract (task generation, complexity analysis, Claude invocation)
   - From run.py: 8 methods/classes (RunEngine, agent phases, gates)
   - Proposed services architecture with 6 service modules

3. **Event Emission Points** (Section 3)
   - 22 existing timeline events mapped for WebSocket broadcasting
   - 5 new events proposed (ITERATION_START/END, OUTPUT_CHUNK, PROGRESS_UPDATE, LOG_ENTRY)
   - EventBus integration strategy documented

4. **CLI Preservation Strategy** (Section 4)
   - Thin wrapper pattern with code examples
   - OutputHandler protocol defined
   - All 10 CLI commands verified

5. **No Breaking Changes** (Sections 5, 9)
   - All CLI arguments/exit codes preserved
   - All file formats unchanged
   - All signal formats unchanged

<task-done session="ralph-20260127-122325-ded58849d39c6fe8">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- Verified comprehensive architecture audit document at docs/architecture-audit-T001.md (636 lines)
- Updated implementation report at .ralph-session/reports/T-001/implementation.md with final verification
- All 5 acceptance criteria confirmed complete with evidence from audit document
- Key findings: TimelineLogger is the core WebSocket integration point, only run.py and cli.py need significant refactoring, all 10 CLI commands already follow thin wrapper pattern
