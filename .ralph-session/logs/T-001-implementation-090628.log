# Command: claude --print --model claude-opus-4-5-20251101 --allowedTools Read,Write,Glob,LS,Grep,Shell,Edit -p '# Implementation Task

You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-001 - Audit existing architecture and identify refactoring boundaries

Analyze current codebase structure (cli.py, run.py, session.py, gates.py, agents/) to identify which logic must be extracted into services layer. Document current dependencies, coupling points, and event emission points needed for real-time updates. Map out how to preserve CLI functionality while making core logic reusable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete dependency map created showing all modules and their interactions
- List of logic to extract from cli.py, run.py into services layer documented
- Event emission points identified for WebSocket broadcasting (task start/stop, agent transitions, gate execution, signal detection)
- CLI preservation strategy documented (keep commands as thin wrappers)
- No breaking changes identified for existing CLI commands

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260127-090628-18a37c3dd4b3ba7a">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260127-090628-18a37c3dd4b3ba7a

# STDOUT:
The architecture audit document at `docs/architecture-audit-T001.md` is already complete and comprehensive. Let me verify it against the acceptance criteria:

**Acceptance Criteria Verification:**

1. ✅ **Complete dependency map created showing all modules and their interactions**
   - Section 1.1: Core Architecture Overview diagram
   - Section 1.2: Detailed Module Dependencies table
   - Section 1.3: Coupling Analysis

2. ✅ **List of logic to extract from cli.py, run.py into services layer documented**
   - Section 2.1: Current cli.py Responsibilities table with line numbers
   - Section 2.2: Current run.py Responsibilities table with line numbers
   - Section 2.3: Proposed Services Layer Structure
   - Section 8.1-8.6: Detailed File Analysis with Line Numbers

3. ✅ **Event emission points identified for WebSocket broadcasting**
   - Section 3.1: Required Events table (18 existing events)
   - Section 3.2: New Events Needed (5 additional events)
   - Section 3.3: Event Bus Implementation Requirements
   - Section 3.4: Integration Points in Existing Code

4. ✅ **CLI preservation strategy documented (keep commands as thin wrappers)**
   - Section 4.1: Design Principle: Thin CLI Wrappers
   - Section 4.2: Refactoring Pattern Example (before/after)
   - Section 4.3: Output Handler Protocol
   - Section 4.4: Backward Compatibility Checklist

5. ✅ **No breaking changes identified for existing CLI commands**
   - Section 5.1-5.3: Breaking Change Analysis
   - Section 9.1: Command Interface Verification table
   - Section 9.2: Environment Variables Preserved
   - Section 9.3: File Formats Preserved
   - Section 9.4: Signal Formats Preserved

All acceptance criteria are satisfied by the existing document. The audit is complete.

<task-done session="ralph-20260127-090628-18a37c3dd4b3ba7a">
