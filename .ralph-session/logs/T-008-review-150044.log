You are reviewing code changes against acceptance criteria.

## IMPORTANT: READ-ONLY MODE

You may NOT modify any files. You can only:
- Read files to review the implementation
- Approve or reject based on criteria

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-008 - Add '"'"'ralph serve'"'"' CLI command

Add '"'"'serve'"'"' subcommand to cli.py that starts the FastAPI server with uvicorn. Support options for port, host, projects-root, auto-open browser, and remote access. Command should initialize services, start project discovery, and launch web server. Update CLI to refactor existing commands to use services layer.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] cli.py updated with '"'"'serve'"'"' subcommand using Click
- [ ] Options: --port (default 3000), --host (default 127.0.0.1), --projects-root (default current dir), --open (auto-open browser), --remote (bind to 0.0.0.0)
- [ ] Warning displayed when --remote flag enables remote connections
- [ ] Command initializes ProjectService with projects-root
- [ ] Command starts uvicorn server with FastAPI app
- [ ] Browser auto-opens to http://localhost:{port} if --open flag set
- [ ] Server logs display startup message with URL
- [ ] Existing CLI commands (run, scan, init, verify) refactored to call services layer
- [ ] All existing CLI integration tests pass unchanged
