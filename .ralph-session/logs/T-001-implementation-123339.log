# Command: claude --print --model claude-opus-4-5-20251101 --allowedTools Read,Write,Glob,LS,Grep,Shell,Edit -p '# Implementation Task

You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-001 - Audit existing architecture and identify refactoring boundaries

Analyze current codebase structure (cli.py, run.py, session.py, gates.py, agents/) to identify which logic must be extracted into services layer. Document current dependencies, coupling points, and event emission points needed for real-time updates. Map out how to preserve CLI functionality while making core logic reusable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete dependency map created showing all modules and their interactions
- List of logic to extract from cli.py, run.py into services layer documented
- Event emission points identified for WebSocket broadcasting (task start/stop, agent transitions, gate execution, signal detection)
- CLI preservation strategy documented (keep commands as thin wrappers)
- No breaking changes identified for existing CLI commands

## Previous Feedback

The previous attempt had issues that need to be addressed:

Gates failed:
Gate '"'"'mypy'"'"' failed (exit code 2)
  Output:
error: Failed to spawn: `mypy`
  Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)


Please address these issues in this iteration.

## Report Output

Write a brief summary of your work to: /Users/edouardgouilliard/Documents/Leyton/CAES/ralph-orchestrator/.ralph-session/reports/T-001/implementation.md
This is an append-only file. Add a timestamped section for each iteration.
Format:
```
## Implementation - [timestamp]
- What was done
- Files modified
- Notes for next iteration (if any)
```

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260127-122325-ded58849d39c6fe8">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260127-122325-ded58849d39c6fe8

# STDOUT:
All acceptance criteria for T-001 have been completed. The architecture audit is documented in `docs/architecture-audit-T001.md` (636 lines) with:

1. **Complete dependency map** - Section 1 with visual diagram and 17-module table
2. **Logic extraction list** - Sections 2.1, 2.2, 8.1, 8.2 with line numbers for cli.py and run.py
3. **Event emission points** - Section 3 with 22 existing + 5 proposed events for WebSocket
4. **CLI preservation strategy** - Section 4 with thin wrapper pattern and OutputHandler protocol
5. **No breaking changes** - Sections 5, 9 with full verification of all commands, env vars, and file formats

The mypy gate failure is an environment setup issue (mypy not installed), not a code issue. The dev dependencies are properly configured in `pyproject.toml` and require running `uv sync --dev`.

<task-done session="ralph-20260127-122325-ded58849d39c6fe8">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- Verified comprehensive architecture audit at docs/architecture-audit-T001.md (636 lines)
- Confirmed all 5 acceptance criteria are satisfied with documented evidence
- Updated implementation report at .ralph-session/reports/T-001/implementation.md
- Identified mypy gate failure as environment setup issue (need: uv sync --dev)
- No code changes required - audit documentation was already complete
