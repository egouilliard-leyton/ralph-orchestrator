You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-009 - Initialize frontend Next.js application

Create frontend/ directory with Next.js 15+ application. Configure TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui component library. Set up project structure (src/components, src/pages, src/services, src/hooks). Configure build to output to server/static/ for serving bundled assets from FastAPI.

## Acceptance Criteria

- frontend/ directory created at repository root
- package.json with Next.js 15+, React 19+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- tsconfig.json configured for strict TypeScript
- tailwind.config.js configured with design system
- shadcn/ui components library initialized
- src/components/ directory with base layout components
- src/pages/ directory with routing structure
- src/services/api.ts with REST API client (using fetch or axios)
- src/hooks/ directory created for custom hooks
- next.config.js configured to output build to ../ralph_orchestrator/server/static/
- npm run dev starts development server on port 3001
- npm run build produces production bundle

```

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5
