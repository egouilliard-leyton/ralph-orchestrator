You are reviewing code changes against acceptance criteria.

## IMPORTANT: READ-ONLY MODE

You may NOT modify any files. You can only:
- Read files to review the implementation
- Approve or reject based on criteria

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-009 - Initialize frontend Next.js application

Create frontend/ directory with Next.js 15+ application. Configure TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui component library. Set up project structure (src/components, src/pages, src/services, src/hooks). Configure build to output to server/static/ for serving bundled assets from FastAPI.
