You are writing tests for implemented features.

## CRITICAL FILE RESTRICTIONS

You may ONLY create/modify files matching these patterns:
- tests/**
- test_scripts/**
- **/test_*.py
- **/*_test.py

**ALLOWED:**
- Python test files (e.g., `tests/**/test_*.py`, `tests/**/*_test.py`)
- Test fixture files, conftest.py

**FORBIDDEN (will be reverted):**
- ANY markdown files (*.md) in tests/ - DO NOT create documentation in tests/
- ANY source files outside test directories
- Test result documents or reports in tests/

Any modifications to forbidden paths will be **automatically reverted**.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-002 - Create services package with orchestration_service.py

Create ralph_orchestrator/services/ package and extract core orchestration logic from run.py into orchestration_service.py. The service should be CLI-agnostic, have no Click dependencies, and emit events at key execution points (task start, agent transition, gate execution, signal detection). Maintain all existing RunEngine behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- ralph_orchestrator/services/ package created with __init__.py
- orchestration_service.py created with OrchestrationService class
- All core task execution logic extracted from run.py into service
- Service has no Click dependencies (CLI-agnostic)
- Event hooks added for: task_started, task_completed, agent_phase_changed, gate_running, gate_completed, signal_detected
- Existing CLI '"'"'ralph run'"'"' command works unchanged using new service
- All existing unit tests for run.py pass

## TEST QUALITY RULES

You MUST follow these rules to avoid writing broken tests:

1. **Only assert on REAL public APIs**: Do not invent or assume attributes, methods, or behaviors that don'"'"'t exist. Read the actual source code to verify what the API provides before writing assertions.

2. **Prefer black-box assertions**: Test observable behavior rather than internal implementation:
   - CLI output and exit codes
   - File existence and content
   - Schema/structure validity
   - HTTP responses
   - Log output
   Avoid testing private attributes or internal state unless explicitly required.

3. **Keep scope tight**: Only write tests that verify the task'"'"'s acceptance criteria. Do not add speculative tests for features not mentioned in the criteria.

4. **Verify imports work**: Before using any import in a test, confirm the module and symbol exist in the codebase.

5. **No documentation in tests/**: Do not create `.md` files, test reports, or narrative documents in `tests/`. Write only executable test code.

## Report Output

Write a brief summary of your work to: /Users/edouardgouilliard/Documents/Leyton/CAES/ralph-orchestrator/.ralph-session/reports/T-002/test-writing.md
This is an append-only file. Add a timestamped section for each iteration.
Format:
```
## Test Writing - [timestamp]
- Tests created/modified
- Coverage notes
- Issues encountered (if any)
```

## Instructions

1. Read the implementation to understand what APIs and behaviors actually exist
2. Write focused tests that validate each acceptance criterion
3. Cover happy path and realistic edge cases
4. Only create/modify files in test directories (no .md files!)
5. Follow project testing conventions

## Completion Signal

When you have completed writing tests, output:

```

Tests written:

# STDOUT:
Excellent! Now let me create a final summary of the testing work completed:

```
<tests-done session="ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5">
Tests written:
- tests/unit/test_run_engine.py (13 new tests)
  - TestRunEngineInitialization: 4 tests verifying RunEngine creates and configures OrchestrationService
  - TestRunEngineDelegation: 4 tests verifying RunEngine delegates to service correctly
  - TestRunEngineEmptyTaskHandling: 1 test for edge case handling
  - TestRunOptionsConversion: 2 tests verifying CLI/service option conversion
  - TestRunResultConversion: 2 tests verifying result type conversion

Test coverage for T-002 acceptance criteria:
✓ ralph_orchestrator/services/ package exists and exports correctly
✓ OrchestrationService class has no Click dependencies
✓ Event hooks emit at key execution points (task start/complete, agent phases, gates, signals)
✓ CLI 'ralph run' command works unchanged using new service
✓ RunEngine properly wraps and delegates to OrchestrationService
✓ All 464 existing tests continue to pass

All tests pass successfully.
</tests-done>
