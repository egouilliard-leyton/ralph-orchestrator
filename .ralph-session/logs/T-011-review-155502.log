# Command: claude --print --dangerously-skip-permissions --model haiku --allowedTools Read,Grep,Glob,LS -p '# Code Review Task (READ-ONLY)

You are reviewing code changes against acceptance criteria.

## IMPORTANT: READ-ONLY MODE

You may NOT modify any files. You can only:
- Read files to review the implementation
- Approve or reject based on criteria

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-011 - Build Kanban task board with drag-and-drop

Create TaskBoard component with three columns (To Do, In Progress, Done). Display tasks from prd.json as draggable cards. Each card shows title, description, acceptance criteria, current agent, status. Implement drag-and-drop reordering. Connect to GET /api/projects/{id}/tasks and WebSocket for real-time task status updates. Add task actions (start, skip, delete).

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] src/components/TaskBoard.tsx component with three columns
- [ ] TaskCard component displays: title, truncated description (expandable), acceptance criteria checklist, current agent indicator, duration/timestamp
- [ ] Drag-and-drop implemented using react-dnd or dnd-kit library
- [ ] Tasks can be reordered within To Do column (persists to prd.json)
- [ ] Click task card to expand and see full details + live agent output
- [ ] Start Task button triggers POST /api/projects/{id}/run
- [ ] Real-time updates via WebSocket move tasks between columns automatically
- [ ] Visual indicators when agent is running (pulsing icon)
- [ ] Skip and Delete task actions implemented
- [ ] Loading and error states handled gracefully
