You are writing tests for implemented features.

## CRITICAL FILE RESTRICTIONS

You may ONLY create/modify files matching these patterns:
- tests/**
- test_scripts/**
- **/test_*.py
- **/*_test.py

**ALLOWED:**
- Python test files (e.g., `tests/**/test_*.py`, `tests/**/*_test.py`)
- Test fixture files, conftest.py

**FORBIDDEN (will be reverted):**
- ANY markdown files (*.md) in tests/ - DO NOT create documentation in tests/
- ANY source files outside test directories
- Test result documents or reports in tests/

Any modifications to forbidden paths will be **automatically reverted**.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-013 - Build git integration UI and log viewer

Create GitPanel component showing current branch, list of all branches with status (commits ahead/behind, last commit). Add actions for branch creation, switching, deletion, and PR creation. Create LogViewer component for real-time log streaming with search, filters, and ANSI color support. Both connect to respective API endpoints and WebSocket for live updates.

## Acceptance Criteria

- src/components/GitPanel.tsx displays current branch prominently
- Branch list shows: name, commits ahead/behind remote, last commit message, timestamp
- Create Branch button with name template input
- Switch Branch dropdown/action
- Delete Branch action with confirmation
- Create PR button opens modal: title (auto-generated), description (from acceptance criteria), one-click creation via POST /api/projects/{id}/pr
- PR creation success shows link to GitHub/GitLab PR
- src/components/LogViewer.tsx streams logs in real-time via WebSocket
- Filters: by agent type, by gate, by log level, by time range
- Search functionality highlights matches
- ANSI color codes rendered correctly
- Auto-scroll toggle
- Download logs button exports as text file

## TEST QUALITY RULES

You MUST follow these rules to avoid writing broken tests:

1. **Only assert on REAL public APIs**: Do not invent or assume attributes, methods, or behaviors that don'"'"'t exist. Read the actual source code to verify what the API provides before writing assertions.

2. **Prefer black-box assertions**: Test observable behavior rather than internal implementation:
   - CLI output and exit codes
   - File existence and content
   - Schema/structure validity
   - HTTP responses
   - Log output
   Avoid testing private attributes or internal state unless explicitly required.

3. **Keep scope tight**: Only write tests that verify the task'"'"'s acceptance criteria. Do not add speculative tests for features not mentioned in the criteria.

4. **Verify imports work**: Before using any import in a test, confirm the module and symbol exist in the codebase.

5. **No documentation in tests/**: Do not create `.md` files, test reports, or narrative documents in `tests/`. Write only executable test code.

## Report Output

Write a brief summary of your work to: /Users/edouardgouilliard/Documents/Leyton/CAES/ralph-orchestrator/.ralph-session/reports/T-013/test-writing.md
This is an append-only file. Add a timestamped section for each iteration.
Format:
```
## Test Writing - [timestamp]
- Tests created/modified
- Coverage notes
- Issues encountered (if any)
```

## Instructions

1. Read the implementation to understand what APIs and behaviors actually exist
2. Write focused tests that validate each acceptance criterion
3. Cover happy path and realistic edge cases
4. Only create/modify files in test directories (no .md files!)
5. Follow project testing conventions
