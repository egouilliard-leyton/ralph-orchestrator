You are writing tests for implemented features.

## CRITICAL FILE RESTRICTIONS

You may ONLY create/modify files matching these patterns:
- tests/**
- test_scripts/**
- **/test_*.py
- **/*_test.py

**ALLOWED:**
- Python test files (e.g., `tests/**/test_*.py`, `tests/**/*_test.py`)
- Test fixture files, conftest.py

**FORBIDDEN (will be reverted):**
- ANY markdown files (*.md) in tests/ - DO NOT create documentation in tests/
- ANY source files outside test directories
- Test result documents or reports in tests/

Any modifications to forbidden paths will be **automatically reverted**.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-003 - Create project discovery and session management services

Create project_service.py to discover all directories with .ralph/ subdirectories and provide project metadata. Create session_service.py to handle session CRUD operations (enhanced from existing session.py). Both services should emit events for state changes and be usable by both CLI and API.

## Acceptance Criteria

- project_service.py created with ProjectService class
- ProjectService.discover_projects() scans filesystem for .ralph/ directories
- ProjectService returns project metadata (name, path, branch, task count, status)
- session_service.py created with SessionService class
- SessionService provides CRUD operations for session data
- SessionService emits events when session state changes
- File watching capability added to detect new/removed projects
- Both services have comprehensive unit tests

## TEST QUALITY RULES

You MUST follow these rules to avoid writing broken tests:

1. **Only assert on REAL public APIs**: Do not invent or assume attributes, methods, or behaviors that don'"'"'t exist. Read the actual source code to verify what the API provides before writing assertions.

2. **Prefer black-box assertions**: Test observable behavior rather than internal implementation:
   - CLI output and exit codes
   - File existence and content
   - Schema/structure validity
   - HTTP responses
   - Log output
   Avoid testing private attributes or internal state unless explicitly required.

3. **Keep scope tight**: Only write tests that verify the task'"'"'s acceptance criteria. Do not add speculative tests for features not mentioned in the criteria.

4. **Verify imports work**: Before using any import in a test, confirm the module and symbol exist in the codebase.

5. **No documentation in tests/**: Do not create `.md` files, test reports, or narrative documents in `tests/`. Write only executable test code.

## Report Output

Write a brief summary of your work to: /Users/edouardgouilliard/Documents/Leyton/CAES/ralph-orchestrator/.ralph-session/reports/T-003/test-writing.md
This is an append-only file. Add a timestamped section for each iteration.
Format:
```
## Test Writing - [timestamp]
- Tests created/modified
- Coverage notes
- Issues encountered (if any)
```

## Instructions

1. Read the implementation to understand what APIs and behaviors actually exist
2. Write focused tests that validate each acceptance criterion
3. Cover happy path and realistic edge cases
4. Only create/modify files in test directories (no .md files!)
5. Follow project testing conventions

## Completion Signal

When you have completed writing tests, output:

```
<tests-done session="ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5">
Tests written:
- [list of test files/functions]

```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5

# STDOUT:
Excellent! All tests pass. Let me create a final summary of what was accomplished:

```
<tests-done session="ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5">
Tests written:
- tests/unit/test_project_service.py: Enhanced with 10 additional tests (44 tests total)
  - TestProjectServiceRefresh: 3 tests for metadata refresh, deletion handling, and multi-change detection
  - TestProjectServiceEdgeCases: 5 tests for invalid JSON/YAML, permission errors, empty tasks, string paths
  - TestEventDataclasses: 2 additional event serialization tests
  
- tests/unit/test_session_service.py: Enhanced with 15 additional tests (57 tests total)
  - TestSessionServiceEdgeCases: 11 tests for string paths, multiple operations, error handling, edge cases
  - TestEventDataclasses: 4 additional event serialization tests

All 101 tests passing (0.95s execution time)

Coverage includes:
✅ Project discovery with filesystem scanning (.ralph/ detection)
✅ Project metadata extraction (name, path, branch, task count, status)
✅ SessionService CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
✅ Event emission for all state changes in both services
✅ File watching for detecting new/removed projects
✅ Edge cases: invalid JSON/YAML, missing files, permission errors, tampering detection
✅ Black-box testing of observable behavior
✅ Event dataclass serialization validation
</tests-done>
