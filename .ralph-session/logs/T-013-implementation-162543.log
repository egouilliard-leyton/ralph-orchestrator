You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-013 - Build git integration UI and log viewer

Create GitPanel component showing current branch, list of all branches with status (commits ahead/behind, last commit). Add actions for branch creation, switching, deletion, and PR creation. Create LogViewer component for real-time log streaming with search, filters, and ANSI color support. Both connect to respective API endpoints and WebSocket for live updates.

## Acceptance Criteria

- src/components/GitPanel.tsx displays current branch prominently
- Branch list shows: name, commits ahead/behind remote, last commit message, timestamp
- Create Branch button with name template input
- Switch Branch dropdown/action
- Delete Branch action with confirmation
- Create PR button opens modal: title (auto-generated), description (from acceptance criteria), one-click creation via POST /api/projects/{id}/pr
- PR creation success shows link to GitHub/GitLab PR
- src/components/LogViewer.tsx streams logs in real-time via WebSocket
- Filters: by agent type, by gate, by log level, by time range
- Search functionality highlights matches
- ANSI color codes rendered correctly
- Auto-scroll toggle
- Download logs button exports as text file
