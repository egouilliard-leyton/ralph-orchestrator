You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-012 - Build workflow editor and config management UI

Create WorkflowEditor component visualizing agent pipeline as connected nodes (Implementation → Test → Gates → Review). Allow drag-and-drop to add/remove agents from palette. Create ConfigEditor component with split-pane view (visual form editor left, YAML preview right) for ralph.yml editing. Both components save changes via PUT /api/projects/{id}/config endpoint with validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- src/components/WorkflowEditor.tsx displays pipeline as visual flowchart
- Agent nodes show: name, type, guardrails summary
- Agent palette sidebar with draggable agent types
- Click agent node to configure (modal with prompt, guardrails settings)
- Gate nodes show command and status
- Add/remove gate buttons with configuration form
- Save button persists pipeline to ralph.yml via API
- src/components/ConfigEditor.tsx with split-pane layout
- Left pane: form editor for common settings (task_source, gates, services)
- Right pane: live YAML preview updates as form changes
- Validation against JSON schema before save (shows errors)
- Save and Reset buttons
- Both components handle loading and error states
