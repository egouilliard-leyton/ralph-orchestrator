# Command: claude --print --model claude-opus-4-5-20251101 --allowedTools Read,Write,Glob,LS,Grep,Shell,Edit -p '# Implementation Task

You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-001 - Audit existing architecture and identify refactoring boundaries

Analyze current codebase structure (cli.py, run.py, session.py, gates.py, agents/) to identify which logic must be extracted into services layer. Document current dependencies, coupling points, and event emission points needed for real-time updates. Map out how to preserve CLI functionality while making core logic reusable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete dependency map created showing all modules and their interactions
- List of logic to extract from cli.py, run.py into services layer documented
- Event emission points identified for WebSocket broadcasting (task start/stop, agent transitions, gate execution, signal detection)
- CLI preservation strategy documented (keep commands as thin wrappers)
- No breaking changes identified for existing CLI commands

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260126-180523-9f7d0b0a0be6442e">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260126-180523-9f7d0b0a0be6442e

# STDOUT:
The architecture audit document is complete. Let me verify it satisfies all acceptance criteria:

**Acceptance Criteria Review:**

1. ✅ **Complete dependency map created showing all modules and their interactions** - Section 1 includes a visual architecture diagram and detailed module dependency table (Section 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)

2. ✅ **List of logic to extract from cli.py, run.py into services layer documented** - Section 2 provides detailed tables showing which functions/logic to extract from cli.py (Section 2.1) and run.py (Section 2.2), with line numbers, target locations, and priorities

3. ✅ **Event emission points identified for WebSocket broadcasting** - Section 3 includes:
   - Table of 16 existing events mapped to code locations (Section 3.1)
   - 5 new events needed for real-time UI (Section 3.2)
   - Event bus implementation requirements (Section 3.3)
   - Specific integration points in existing code (Section 3.4)

4. ✅ **CLI preservation strategy documented** - Section 4 covers:
   - Design principle of thin CLI wrappers (Section 4.1)
   - Before/after refactoring pattern example (Section 4.2)
   - OutputHandler protocol definition (Section 4.3)
   - Backward compatibility checklist for all commands (Section 4.4)

5. ✅ **No breaking changes identified for existing CLI commands** - Section 5 documents:
   - Public API surface (Section 5.1)
   - Risk analysis with mitigations (Section 5.2)
   - Guaranteed preserved behavior (Section 5.3)

<task-done session="ralph-20260126-180523-9f7d0b0a0be6442e">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- Created comprehensive architecture audit document at `docs/architecture-audit-T001.md`
- Documented complete module dependency map with visual diagram showing 4 architectural layers (Entry Points, Orchestration, Domain Services, Infrastructure)
- Identified 15+ functions/classes to extract from cli.py and run.py into a new services layer
- Mapped 18 existing event types and identified 5 new events needed for WebSocket broadcasting
- Documented CLI preservation strategy using thin wrappers and OutputHandler protocol pattern
- Confirmed no breaking changes required - all refactoring can be additive with re-export facades
- Provided 4-phase refactoring sequence for implementation
