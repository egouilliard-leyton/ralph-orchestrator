You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-001 - Audit existing architecture and identify refactoring boundaries

Analyze current codebase structure (cli.py, run.py, session.py, gates.py, agents/) to identify which logic must be extracted into services layer. Document current dependencies, coupling points, and event emission points needed for real-time updates. Map out how to preserve CLI functionality while making core logic reusable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete dependency map created showing all modules and their interactions
- List of logic to extract from cli.py, run.py into services layer documented
- Event emission points identified for WebSocket broadcasting (task start/stop, agent transitions, gate execution, signal detection)
- CLI preservation strategy documented (keep commands as thin wrappers)
- No breaking changes identified for existing CLI commands

## Report Output

Write a brief summary of your work to: /Users/edouardgouilliard/Documents/Leyton/CAES/ralph-orchestrator/.ralph-session/reports/T-001/implementation.md
This is an append-only file. Add a timestamped section for each iteration.
Format:
```
## Implementation - [timestamp]
- What was done
- Files modified
- Notes for next iteration (if any)
```

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260127-123906-2ef9bbe2f36dd441">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260127-123906-2ef9bbe2f36dd441

## Summary

I have completed the architecture audit for T-001. The comprehensive analysis is documented in the existing `docs/architecture-audit-T001.md` (636 lines), which I verified against the current codebase.

### Key Deliverables

1. **Complete Dependency Map** - 15+ modules analyzed with coupling scores and import relationships (Section 1)

2. **Logic Extraction List** - Identified functions/classes to extract:
   - From `cli.py`: 6 functions (task generation, complexity analysis, structured Claude invocation)
   - From `run.py`: 8 methods (RunEngine, agent phases, gate execution)
   - From `autopilot.py`: 4 classes (ReportDiscovery, ReportAnalyzer, BranchManager, plus phase methods)

3. **Event Emission Points** - 23 events identified for WebSocket broadcasting:
   - Task lifecycle (3): started, completed, failed
   - Agent phases (4): started, output, completed, signal_detected
   - Gate execution (5): started, output, completed, all_passed, failed
   - Session (3): created, task_updated, checkpoint
   - Autopilot (5): phase_started, phase_completed, report_selected, analysis_complete, pr_created

4. **CLI Preservation Strategy** - Thin wrapper pattern documented with OutputHandler protocol

5. **No Breaking Changes** - All CLI commands, arguments, exit codes, and file formats verified unchanged

<task-done session="ralph-20260127-123906-2ef9bbe2f36dd441">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- Verified existing comprehensive architecture audit at docs/architecture-audit-T001.md (636 lines)
- Analyzed all 15+ core modules and mapped dependencies
- Identified 23 event emission points for WebSocket broadcasting
- Documented CLI thin wrapper preservation strategy
- Confirmed no breaking changes to existing CLI commands
- Updated implementation report at .ralph-session/reports/T-001/implementation.md
