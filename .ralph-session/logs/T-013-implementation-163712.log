You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-013 - Build git integration UI and log viewer

Create GitPanel component showing current branch, list of all branches with status (commits ahead/behind, last commit). Add actions for branch creation, switching, deletion, and PR creation. Create LogViewer component for real-time log streaming with search, filters, and ANSI color support. Both connect to respective API endpoints and WebSocket for live updates.

## Acceptance Criteria

- src/components/GitPanel.tsx displays current branch prominently
- Branch list shows: name, commits ahead/behind remote, last commit message, timestamp
- Create Branch button with name template input
- Switch Branch dropdown/action
- Delete Branch action with confirmation
- Create PR button opens modal: title (auto-generated), description (from acceptance criteria), one-click creation via POST /api/projects/{id}/pr
- PR creation success shows link to GitHub/GitLab PR
- src/components/LogViewer.tsx streams logs in real-time via WebSocket
- Filters: by agent type, by gate, by log level, by time range
- Search functionality highlights matches
- ANSI color codes rendered correctly
- Auto-scroll toggle
- Download logs button exports as text file

## Report Output

Write a brief summary of your work to: /Users/edouardgouilliard/Documents/Leyton/CAES/ralph-orchestrator/.ralph-session/reports/T-013/implementation.md
This is an append-only file. Add a timestamped section for each iteration.
Format:
```
## Implementation - [timestamp]
- What was done
- Files modified
- Notes for next iteration (if any)
```

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5

<task-done session="ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- Fixed bug in `ralph_orchestrator/services/git_service.py:557-559` where `get_status()` method was incorrectly parsing git porcelain output due to using `strip()` before `split("\n")`, which removed leading spaces that indicate file staging status
- Changed from `strip().split("\n")` to `splitlines()` to preserve leading whitespace in each line
- Verified all 1192 tests pass
- Verified GitPanel and LogViewer components exist and meet all acceptance criteria
