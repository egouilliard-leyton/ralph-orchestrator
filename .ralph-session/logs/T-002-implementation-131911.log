You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-002 - Create services package with orchestration_service.py

Create ralph_orchestrator/services/ package and extract core orchestration logic from run.py into orchestration_service.py. The service should be CLI-agnostic, have no Click dependencies, and emit events at key execution points (task start, agent transition, gate execution, signal detection). Maintain all existing RunEngine behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- ralph_orchestrator/services/ package created with __init__.py
- orchestration_service.py created with OrchestrationService class
- All core task execution logic extracted from run.py into service
- Service has no Click dependencies (CLI-agnostic)
- Event hooks added for: task_started, task_completed, agent_phase_changed, gate_running, gate_completed, signal_detected
- Existing CLI '"'"'ralph run'"'"' command works unchanged using new service
- All existing unit tests for run.py pass

## Report Output

Write a brief summary of your work to: /Users/edouardgouilliard/Documents/Leyton/CAES/ralph-orchestrator/.ralph-session/reports/T-002/implementation.md
This is an append-only file. Add a timestamped section for each iteration.
Format:
```
## Implementation - [timestamp]
- What was done
- Files modified
- Notes for next iteration (if any)
```

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5
