You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-004 - Create config and git services

Create config_service.py to handle ralph.yml CRUD operations (enhanced from config.py) with validation. Create git_service.py to handle git operations (branch creation, switching, PR creation via GitHub/GitLab API). Both services emit events and are CLI-agnostic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- config_service.py created with ConfigService class
- ConfigService provides get/update operations for ralph.yml
- ConfigService validates against JSON schema before saving
- ConfigService emits events on config changes
- git_service.py created with GitService class
- GitService supports branch operations (list, create, switch, delete)
- GitService supports PR creation with template-based descriptions
- GitService handles git credentials securely
- Both services have unit tests with mocked filesystem/git operations

## Report Output

Write a brief summary of your work to: /Users/edouardgouilliard/Documents/Leyton/CAES/ralph-orchestrator/.ralph-session/reports/T-004/implementation.md
This is an append-only file. Add a timestamped section for each iteration.
Format:
```
## Implementation - [timestamp]
- What was done
- Files modified
- Notes for next iteration (if any)
```

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5

Implementation complete. Changes:
- Created `ralph_orchestrator/services/config_service.py` with ConfigService class providing CRUD operations for ralph.yml, validation against JSON schema, and event emission on config changes
- Created `ralph_orchestrator/services/git_service.py` with GitService class supporting branch operations (list, create, switch, delete), PR creation with template-based descriptions via gh/glab CLI, and secure credential handling
- Updated `ralph_orchestrator/services/__init__.py` to export both new services and their types
- Created `tests/unit/test_config_service.py` with 49 comprehensive unit tests
- Created `tests/unit/test_git_service.py` with 52 unit tests using mocked filesystem/git operations
- All 101 tests pass
