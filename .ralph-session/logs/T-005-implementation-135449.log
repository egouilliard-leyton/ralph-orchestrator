You are implementing a task for a software project.

## Project
Transform Ralph Orchestrator into a dual-interface system with CLI and modern web UI. Add multi-project management, real-time monitoring, Kanban task visualization, workflow editor, and git integration while preserving all existing CLI functionality.

## Task: T-005 - Implement event system for real-time broadcasting

Create server/events.py with event type definitions and event emitter/subscriber pattern. Design event schema for all UI updates (task started/completed, agent output, gate execution, signal detection). Implement event queue and broadcasting mechanism that will integrate with WebSocket layer.

## Acceptance Criteria

- server/events.py created with Event base class
- Event types defined: TaskStarted, TaskCompleted, AgentOutput, AgentPhaseChanged, GateRunning, GateCompleted, SignalDetected, SessionChanged, ConfigChanged
- Each event includes: type, project_id, timestamp, and type-specific data
- EventEmitter class implemented with subscribe/emit methods
- EventQueue class for buffering events before WebSocket broadcast
- All services (orchestration, session, config, git) integrated with event emitter
- Unit tests verify events emitted at correct times with correct data

## Report Output

Write a brief summary of your work to: /Users/edouardgouilliard/Documents/Leyton/CAES/ralph-orchestrator/.ralph-session/reports/T-005/implementation.md
This is an append-only file. Add a timestamped section for each iteration.
Format:
```
## Implementation - [timestamp]
- What was done
- Files modified
- Notes for next iteration (if any)
```

## Instructions

1. Implement the required changes to satisfy all acceptance criteria
2. Follow project conventions and best practices
3. When complete, output the completion signal

## Completion Signal

When you have completed the implementation, you MUST output this signal:

```
<task-done session="ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- [describe what you changed]
</task-done>
```

IMPORTANT: The session token must be exactly: ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5

# STDOUT:
Implementation is complete and verified. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

<task-done session="ralph-20260127-130602-fad836b2249411c5">
Implementation complete. Changes:
- Created `server/events.py` with the complete event system for real-time broadcasting (1108 lines)
- Created `server/__init__.py` with package exports
- Created `tests/unit/test_events.py` with comprehensive unit tests (59 tests, all passing)

The event system includes:
1. **Event base class** with type, project_id, timestamp, event_id fields
2. **9 event types**: TaskStarted, TaskCompleted, AgentOutput, AgentPhaseChanged, GateRunning, GateCompleted, SignalDetected, SessionChanged, ConfigChanged
3. **EventEmitter class** with subscribe/emit pattern (supports type-specific, global, and project-specific subscriptions)
4. **EventQueue class** for buffering events before WebSocket broadcast (with filtering, async support, max size eviction)
5. **Service bridge integration** via `create_service_bridge()` that connects all existing services (orchestration, session, config, git) to the event emitter
